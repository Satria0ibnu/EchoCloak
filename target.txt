Security Concerns:

File Upload Validation: While you check file extensions (allowed_file function), 
remember that file extensions can be spoofed. 
Consider implementing additional validation methods such as file header inspection (magic bytes) 
to verify file types more securely.

Secure File Handling: Ensure secure handling of uploaded files, 
especially in terms of storage and access permissions (secure_filename is a good start, 
but ensure other security measures are in place).


File Management and Cleanup:

Cleanup Function Execution: Currently, cleanup_old_files() is called once at the start (if __name__ == '__main__') 
but not periodically thereafter. For effective cleanup based on MAX_STORAGE_TIME, 
consider scheduling this function to run periodically (e.g., using a cron job or a scheduled task).

File Overwrite Risk: There's a risk of overwriting existing files if two files with the same name are uploaded. 
Consider using unique filenames or implementing a strategy to handle file conflicts.
